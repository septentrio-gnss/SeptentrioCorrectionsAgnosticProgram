# Set Up Guide to use Third Party OSR and SSR correction services with Septentrio's Receivers for precise positioning

## GENERAL CONTEXT

### Why GNSS Corrections
  
GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) technology has revolutionized the way we navigate and position ourselves, with applications ranging from transportation to surveying and agriculture. GNSS provides location information based on signals received from satellites, but the accuracy of this information can be affected by various factors such as atmospheric conditions and signal blockages. To mitigate these effects, GNSS corrections are used to improve the accuracy of the position measurements.

## New GNSS Corrections mechanisms
  
In recent years, there has been a growing demand for high-accuracy positioning in various industries, including agriculture. This has led to the evolution of GNSS correction mechanisms, such as OSR (Observation Space Representation), SSR (State Space Representation) or LBand delivery, which provide higher accuracy and lower convergence time. However, with the introduction of multiple formats in the market, standardization is yet to be fully established, making it challenging for users to access and use these corrections.

## Facilitating GNSS corrections integration in agnostic way
  
To address this challenge, it is important to create an ecosystem around GNSS corrections that is agnostic, allowing users to access and use corrections from different providers easily. This way, users can take advantage of the growing range of correction options available, without being restricted to a single format or provider. In this context, this repository explores the importance of having GNSS corrections in an agnostic way, providing a brief overview of what corrections are and the evolution of correction mechanisms to newer formats through exploring the integration of corrections of companies with which Septentrio collaborates.

## Possibility of integrating correction services according to requirements and needs
  
Different options and flexibility are crucial when it comes to integrating GNSS technology. While corrections are a fundamental element of achieving high accuracy, having the ability to choose from a variety of corrections services allows for greater flexibility and adaptability as these services continue to evolve over time. Different applications have different requirements, and each service offers unique advantages in terms of performance and different coverage regions.

## Make it easy
  
It's important to make it easy for users/integrators to evaluate these options and choose the best service for their needs.  Additionally, making these options easily accessible to the community is equally important. Platforms like Github enable to document and create demonstrators that allow users to try out different correction services with ease.

Some of the guidelines may require additional instructions or steps to be followed, which are common among multiple companies' implementations. To help streamline the process, we've included extra guides in this repository, such as the implementation guide for setting up your Raspberry Pi 4 Model B and Septentrio Mosaix-X5 receiver.

In the <a href="https://github.com/septentrio-gnss/Septentrio_AgnosticCorrectionsProgram#other-guides">following section below</a> you can access this and other complementary guides.

## Other guides

This repository additionally contains other guides that are complementary to the implementation guides of the different libraries, APIs and SDKs of the different companies with which Septentrio collaborates for this project. 
   
 ### Raspberry Pi 4 Model B and Mosaic-Go GNSS module receiver evaluation kit setup

The main example of these complementary guides is the Set Up Guide to use Third parties corrections with Septentrio's Receiver for precise positioning, which is the setup on which all implementations of these libraries, APIs and SDKs are based.

### RTKLIB str2str tool compilation and use guide

This repository is about how to implement the tool called **str2str from the RTKLIB library**. The use of the tool consists of downloading the RTKLIB repository, compiling the str2str tool and using it to connect to an NTRIP Server/Caster and forward the incoming corrections to the receiver.

The str2str tool **is running inside the Raspberry Pi and it creates an NTRIP client** to access the corrections, while sending them to the receiver. The steps for how to download, compile and use the tool for this specific application can be found in the following guide:

### Transmit internet connection through the Raspberry Pi to the receiver using a USB cable guide

This is another alternative for using NTRIP. In this case you would be using the NTRIP Client within the Septentrio Module.

The guide consists of executing a series of commands that configure the Raspberry Pi operating system to provide internet to a device that is connected to the Raspberry Pi through a USB cable. Therefore, if we connect the receiver to the Raspberry Pi with a USB cable after executing the commands, the receiver, and therefore its NTRIP client, will have access to the internet to get the corrections of the selected provider.
